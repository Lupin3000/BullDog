# BullDog

Python USB OTG HID (Keyboard)

> Inspired by RubberDucky, O.MG and other nice tools, I created this Python BullDog barking. As I was a little unhappy with the DuckyScript syntax, I changed this.

## Usage

```shell
# simple barking
$ ./BullDog.py woof.txt

# simple barking with default delay
$ ./BullDog.py woof.txt -d 0.05
```

the woof.txt (_text file_)...

```
# This is my test script
[CMD] GUI SPACE
Terminal
[CMD] ENTER

```
